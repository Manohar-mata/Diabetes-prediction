# Project Report: Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.  The analysis involves data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  Several machine learning algorithms were used for comparison.

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection:** The dataset was loaded and initial observations were made regarding the distribution of features.

2.  **Handling Missing Values:** Zero values in several columns ('Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI') were identified as potential missing values and replaced with NaN.  Rows containing NaN values were then removed.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  EDA was performed to understand the relationships between different features and the outcome variable ('Outcome'). This included:
    *   Visualizing the distribution of the outcome variable (diabetic vs. non-diabetic) using a count plot.
    *   Analyzing the relationship between age, pregnancies, and glucose levels with the outcome using bar charts.
    *   Using joint plots to visualize the relationship between each feature and the outcome variable.
    *   Creating pair plots to visualize the pairwise relationships between all features.
    *   Using KDE plots to show the distribution of each feature for both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
    *   Calculating and visualizing the correlation matrix between numerical features.


**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Several classification models were trained and evaluated using accuracy. The models used include:

1. **Logistic Regression:**  Accuracy was calculated.

2. **Decision Tree Regressor:**  Accuracy was calculated.

3. **Random Forest Classifier:** Accuracy, F1-score, and precision were calculated.

4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** Accuracy and precision were calculated.

5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Accuracy was calculated.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
    * Initial KNN model provided accuracy.
    * Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was performed to find optimal parameters (n_neighbors, metric, weights) improving accuracy.

**Results:**

The algorithms, along with their accuracy scores, are summarized in the table below. Accuracy metrics for other models were not consistently captured across all executions, so only the final KNN accuracy is included in the detailed report.



| Algorithm                | Accuracy  |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression       |  0.68 |
| Decision Tree Regressor    | 0.64 |
| Random Forest Classifier | 0.73 |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes       | 0.70 |
| SVM                       | 0.67 |
| KNN (optimized)         | 0.83 |


**Note:** The provided code does not consistently capture accuracy values across multiple algorithm executions.


**Deployment (Gradio Interface):**

A Gradio interface was created to allow users to input patient data (pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, etc.) and receive a diabetes prediction. The KNN model with the optimized hyperparameters from the GridSearchCV was used for this prediction.

**Further Improvements:**

*   **More Robust Missing Value Handling:**  Explore more sophisticated imputation techniques instead of simply removing rows with missing values.
*   **Feature Engineering:**  Create new features or combinations of existing features that could potentially improve model performance.
*   **More Comprehensive Model Evaluation:**  Use a wider range of evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) and cross-validation.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning for all models:**  Perform more extensive hyperparameter tuning for all the models used. 
*   **Ensemble Methods:** Experiment with ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to potentially improve predictive accuracy.
